More intuitive management interface for hierarchical post types.

## Description ##

This plugin provides several useful components:
* Navigation manager - Drag and drop interface for ordering hierarchical post types (i.e pages)
* Content navigation widget - Automatically generate sidebar navigation from your sites content
* Primary navigation bar - Alternative to custom menus, automatically populated from the post parent and menu order of the content (requires theme support)
* Navigation labels
* Exclude from navigation
* Optionally prevent users from adding highly visible top level content

For developers, a navigation library exists as an efficient alternative to WP_Query for querying posts with hierarchical post types.

## Installation ##

1. Upload `bu-navigation` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Manage your primary navigation settings through "Appearance > Primary Navigation"

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
